# TriviaApp

A Trivia Game web app built using Blazor Web App that connects to free public API's for the data (https://opentdb.com/ only for now).

Future features include:
- allow sign-in and preserve user data using Azure AD
- allow users to add their custom questions and store them in Azure (SQL/Cosmos/etc.)
- change Core API layer to be Azure Functions instead (free tier)
- allow users to create their own templated games for others to use
